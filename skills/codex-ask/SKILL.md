Get an independent answer, implementation plan, or debugging analysis from OpenAI's Codex CLI using GPT-5.4 with maximum reasoning effort. Codex acts as a principal engineer providing a second opinion. You have more context than Codex — use your own judgment to decide what to incorporate.

## Invoking Codex

Use `codex exec` to run a one-shot query. Always write output to a temp file for reliable capture. Select the sandbox level based on the mode.

```bash
TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-ask.XXXXXXXX)
[ -f "$HOME/.codex/.env" ] && . "$HOME/.codex/.env"
codex exec \
  -m gpt-5.4 \
  -c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"' \
  -s "$SANDBOX" \
  --ephemeral \
  -o "$TMPFILE" \
  "$PROMPT"
cat "$TMPFILE"
rm "$TMPFILE"
```

**Flags explained:**
- `-m gpt-5.4` — model selection
- `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"'` — maximum thinking effort
- `-s "$SANDBOX"` — sandbox level, varies by mode (see below)
- `--ephemeral` — no conversation persistence, clean context
- `-o "$TMPFILE"` — write output to file (avoids noisy stdout metadata)

**Critical — temp file creation:** Use `mktemp` exactly as shown. Do NOT add a file extension after the X's — `mktemp` only replaces trailing X's. The template `/tmp/codex-ask.XXXXXXXX` (no extension) must be used verbatim.

**Error handling:** If codex returns a non-zero exit code, read stderr, report the error to the user, and do not retry automatically.

## Three Modes

Determine the mode from the user's request. Each mode uses a different sandbox level:

| Mode | Sandbox | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| Question | `-s read-only` | Only needs to read code, no writes needed |
| Plan | `-s read-only` | Only needs to read code to design a plan |
| Debug | `-s danger-full-access` | May need to run tests, try fixes, execute build commands |

### Choosing the mode
- If the user explicitly says "plan", "design", or "implement" → Plan
- If the user mentions a bug, failure, error, test failing, or unexpected behavior → Debug
- Otherwise → Question (the safe default)
- When ambiguous, briefly ask the user which mode they prefer.

### Mode 1: Question (ask)

For general questions about the codebase, architecture, or implementation approach.
**Sandbox:** `read-only`

### Mode 2: Plan

For implementation planning — designing a feature, migration strategy, or refactoring approach.
**Sandbox:** `read-only`

### Mode 3: Debug

For debugging — diagnosing failures, unexpected behavior, or test failures. Codex gets full access so it can run tests, try compilation, execute the failing code, and actively investigate.
**Sandbox:** `danger-full-access`

**Note:** The third sandbox option `workspace-write` (read broadly, write within workspace) is available but not used by default. Override manually if a question or plan mode needs limited write access.

## Constructing the Prompt

Codex has shell access — it can run git commands and read files itself. Don't bloat the prompt by embedding file contents. Tell Codex *what* to look at and let it retrieve the code.

Every prompt must include:

### 1. Role and context (required)

Set the role and provide brief context about the codebase and the current situation.

### 2. The question or task (required)

State clearly what Codex should answer, plan, or debug.

### 3. Scope pointers (required)

Tell Codex which files, directories, or git commands to examine. Examples:
- "Read `src/auth/` to understand the current auth implementation"
- "Run `git log --oneline -20` to see recent changes"
- "Read `config.toml` and `src/main.rs` for the relevant context"

### 4. Output format (required)

Use the appropriate format for the mode:

**Question format:**
```
Return your answer as plain text in this format:

## Answer
Direct answer to the question with supporting reasoning.

## Evidence
Specific files, lines, or code patterns that support your answer.

## Caveats
Assumptions made or things you couldn't verify. If none, write "None."

Do NOT include metadata or commentary outside this format.
If you cannot access a file or run a command, say so clearly.
```

**Plan format:**
```
Return your plan as plain text in this format:

## Approach
High-level strategy in 2-3 sentences.

## Steps
Numbered implementation steps. For each step include:
- What to do
- Which files to create or modify
- Key implementation details

## Risks and Trade-offs
Potential issues, edge cases, or alternative approaches considered.

## Open Questions
Decisions that need human input before proceeding. If none, write "None."

Do NOT include metadata or commentary outside this format.
If you cannot access a file or run a command, say so clearly.
```

**Debug format:**
```
You have full shell access (danger-full-access) — you can read files, run builds, execute tests, and try fixes directly.

Return your analysis as plain text in this format:

## Diagnosis
Root cause or most likely cause of the issue.

## Evidence
Specific code paths, log patterns, or state that points to the root cause.
Include any test output, build errors, or runtime logs you collected.

## Fix
Concrete steps to fix the issue. Reference specific files and lines.
If you were able to try a fix, describe what you changed and whether it worked.

## Verification
How to verify the fix works — test commands you ran, expected vs actual output, or assertions.

Do NOT include metadata or commentary outside this format.
If you cannot access a file or run a command, say so clearly.
```

### Example prompts

**Question:**
```
You are a principal engineer examining a git repository. Context:

This is a Java-Rust hybrid blockchain node (java-tron). The storage layer is being migrated from embedded Java RocksDB to a remote Rust gRPC service.

**Question:** How does the StorageSpiFactory decide whether to use embedded or remote storage? What are all the configuration sources it checks?

Read `framework/src/main/java/org/tron/core/storage/spi/StorageSpiFactory.java` and any files it references. If you need more context, run git commands to explore.

[... format instructions ...]
```

**Plan:**
```
You are a principal engineer planning an implementation. Context:

This is a Java-Rust hybrid blockchain node. We need to add support for a new transaction type in the Rust execution engine.

**Task:** Design a plan to implement VoteWitnessContract execution in Rust, maintaining parity with the Java VoteWitnessActuator.

Read `actuator/src/main/java/org/tron/core/actuator/VoteWitnessActuator.java` and `rust-backend/execution/src/` to understand both sides. If you need more context, explore freely.

[... format instructions ...]
```

**Debug:**
```
You are a principal engineer debugging an issue. Context:

This is a Java-Rust hybrid blockchain node. After enabling remote execution mode, state digests diverge at block 12345.

**Issue:** The SHA256 state digest from embedded (Java) execution differs from remote (Rust) execution for TransferContract transactions.

Run `git diff` to see recent changes. Read `framework/src/main/java/org/tron/core/execution/spi/RuntimeSpiImpl.java` and `rust-backend/execution/src/transfer.rs`. If you need more context, explore freely.

[... format instructions ...]
```

### Important:
- Always tell Codex it can run git commands if it needs more context.
- Always tell Codex to return an error message (not silently fail) if it cannot access something.

## Processing Codex's Response

### 1. Assess the response yourself

Do NOT blindly relay Codex's answer. You have far more context about:
- The broader codebase and its conventions
- The user's intent and constraints
- What has already been tried or discussed
- Project-specific patterns and trade-offs

For each point, decide:
- **Incorporate** — correct and valuable
- **Adapt** — right spirit, needs adjustment for this codebase
- **Discard** — wrong, irrelevant, or conflicts with known constraints

### 2. Report to the user

Present a clear summary:

**Codex's Take:**
- Key points from Codex's response

**My Assessment:**
- Which points are solid and why
- Which need adjustment and why
- Which to discard and why

**Synthesis:**
- Combined recommendation incorporating both perspectives
- Any points needing the user's judgment

### 3. Act if appropriate

- For **questions**: synthesize the answer, noting where you agree or disagree with Codex
- For **plans**: merge Codex's plan with your own knowledge, flag conflicts
- For **debug**: if the diagnosis is sound and you can fix it, offer to fix it

### 4. If Codex returns errors

Report the error clearly. Do NOT retry automatically. Suggest what the user might check (codex auth, file permissions, etc.).

## What NOT to Do

- Do not treat Codex's response as authoritative — it is a second opinion, not the final word.
- Do not call Codex repeatedly in a loop trying to get different answers.
- Do not embed large file contents in the prompt — let Codex read them itself.
- Do not skip your own assessment — the user relies on your judgment to filter and contextualize.
